# My-Python-Code
This a repository of some of my previous work. These are primarily assignments from CMPT 120 and little projects I made to practice my coding abilities.

The code is all in Python, if you'd like you can copy it into wherever you run Python. I really like using Repl.it, a site where you can create and run code in various different languages
