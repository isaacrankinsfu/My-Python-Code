#  My-Python-Code

# _This a repository of some of my previous work. These are primarily assignments from CMPT 120 and little projects I made to practice my coding abilities._
#
#
#
# _Here is one of my projects I'm especially proud of, it's a bit goofy but I really enjoyed working on this project so I wanted to show it off as an example of what you'll find in this repository_
#
# _I took a bunch of standard yellow bananas then turned them pink!_ 
# _We start with these..._

# _Then write a program..._

# _With a function which picks up the relevant shades of yellow based on RGB values..._

# _Then magically we have "gmo" pink bananas!_
# _Who wouldn't love to try a pink banana?_

# _All my code in this repository is in Python, if you'd like, you can copy it into wherever you run Python. I really like using Repl.it, a site where you can create and run code in various different languages_
