# _This a repository of some of my previous work. These are primarily assignments from CMPT 120 and little projects I made to practice my coding abilities._

# _Here is one of my proudest projects_

# _I took a bunch of standard yellow bananas then turned them pink!_

# _All my code in this repository is in Python, if you'd like, you can copy it into wherever you run Python. I really like using Repl.it, a site where you can create and run code in various different languages_
